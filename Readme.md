# Pwned Passwords Checker

This command-line program checks whether passwords have been compromised in data breaches using the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) public API or a local compromised password database. It also includes a password strength checker that analyzes the strength of a given password based on several criteria and returns a score indicating how strong the password is.

## üöÄ Installation

To use this program, you will need to have Rust installed on your system. See [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for instructions on how to install Rust.

Once Rust is installed, you can download and build the program by cloning this repository and running the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The built binary will be located in the `target/release/` directory.

## üõ† Usage

The program can be run from the command line using the following syntax:

```sh
pwned-passwords [OPTIONS] <passwords>...
```

where `<passwords>` is a list of passwords to check.
Each password should be provided as a separate command-line argument.

The program supports the following options:

- `--strength`: check password strength (default: false)
- `--local-db PATH`: path to a local compromised password database file (default: none)

### Example Usage

```sh
pwned-passwords --strength "password123" "correct horse battery staple" --local-db "path/to/database.txt"
```

This command will check the passwords "password123" and "correct horse battery staple" for compromise using the local compromised password database at "path/to/database.txt". It will also check their strength and return a score indicating their relative strength.

## üîí Password Strength

The password strength checker included in this program analyzes the strength of a given password based on several criteria, including:

- **Length:** The longer the password, the stronger it is.
- **Complexity:** Passwords that include a combination of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols are stronger than those that do not.
- **Uniqueness:** Passwords that are unique and not found in data breaches are stronger than those that have been compromised.

The password strength checker returns a score between 0 and 5 indicating the strength of the password based on these criteria. A score of 0 indicates a very weak password, while a score of 5 indicates a very strong password.

If the `--strength` option is used when running the program, the password strength score will be printed along with the check result. If the score is below a certain threshold (in this case, 3), the program will advise the user to choose a stronger password.

## üìÅ Local Compromised Password Database

In addition to using the online "Have I Been Pwned" API, the program also supports loading a local compromised password database from a file. This can be useful in situations where network connectivity is limited or when there is a need for additional security by not querying an external API.

The local database file should contain a list of password hashes and the number of times that password has been found in a data breach, separated by a colon (":"). The hash should be in SHA-1 format, represented as a 40-digit hexadecimal number.

For example:

```sh
005D0E6F8F9EA98F1A1E2F45C4328F69A176:32
00FD60FABDDB6E733F7A474F6A50ED7D9461:1
018E250F97CF178F3F3CAE29F8F7B707311A:349
```

The program will use the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash of the password being checked to look up matching hashes in the database. If a match is found, it will check the remaining characters of the hash to see if the password has been found in a data breach.

If the `--local-db` option is used when running the program, the program will use the specified file as the local compromised password database instead of querying the "Have I Been Pwned" API.
